1. What is the Big O for this?

1.1) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 
15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So 
you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You 
stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate 
for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

Constant time complexity O(1) â€” no matter how many people are in the room, you only have 
to perform a singular action. The time it takes to get a result independent of the size of 
the inputs, the size of the crowd in the room.

1.2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 
people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want 
to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with 
the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the 
next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there 
is no one else to ask.

Linear time complexity O(n) â€” the average case is that the person who has a dog is somewhere 
in the middle of the line/array. This would mean that the time it takes to find a similar dog 
breed would depend on the size on the size of the input, the size of the line/crowd. There would 
be a directly proportional relationship. In the worst case, the time complexity would still be O(n) 
because the owner with a similar dog breed would be at the very end of the line. In the best 
case, with the very owner having a similar dog breed, this would be a O(1) time complexity.
